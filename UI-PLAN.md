# UI Improvement Plan

After analyzing the current UI implementation, I've identified several challenges that need to be addressed:

1. **Svelte 5 Compatibility**: The project is using Svelte 5, which has significant changes in syntax and APIs compared to Svelte 3/4. This is causing compatibility issues with our UI improvements.

2. **DaisyUI Integration**: We need to ensure all components properly leverage DaisyUI's styling and components.

## Recommended Approach

I recommend a phased approach to implementing UI improvements:

### Phase 1: Basic Theme Setup
- Configure DaisyUI themes
- Setup theme switching functionality
- Adjust layout for responsive design

### Phase 2: Core Component Enhancements
- Improve ImageUpload component with better visual feedback
- Enhance SvgPreview with advanced comparison tools
- Redesign TraceControls for better organization

### Phase 3: Interaction and Animation
- Add subtle animations for state changes
- Implement proper loading indicators
- Add toast notifications for user feedback

## Implementation Details

### Theme & Layout Structure
- Use DaisyUI's "corporate" theme as default with "dark" as an alternative
- Implement a proper Navbar with theme toggle
- Create a responsive container layout
- Add a footer with helpful links and information

### File Upload Component Improvements
- Replace current dropzone with a styled card component
- Add animated feedback for drag interactions
- Improve file type indication
- Add progress indicators for uploads/processing

### SVG Preview Enhancements
- Implement side-by-side comparison view
- Add zoom controls with keyboard shortcuts
- Create split-view with adjustable divider
- Improve download options with formats

### Trace Controls Refinements
- Organize controls into logical groupings
- Use collapsible sections for advanced settings
- Add tooltips to explain parameters
- Use tabs to organize different setting categories

### Animation & Feedback
- Add transitions between states
- Implement progress animations
- Add toast notifications for actions
- Improve error messages

## Technical Notes
The current implementation shows we need to be careful with Svelte 5 syntax. Key differences include:
- Props: Using `let { propName } = $props()` instead of `export let propName`
- State: Using `$state` for reactive variables
- Effects: Using `$effect` instead of `onMount`
- Event Dispatching: Using global event dispatcher

During implementation, we should focus on one component at a time, ensuring it works correctly before moving on to the next.

Given the Svelte 5 compatibility issues, it may be more efficient to start with a clean implementation of each component rather than trying to adapt the current ones.
